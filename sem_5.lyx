\begin_layout Standard
The historical development of servitization of computer games follows the
 general arc;

\begin_layout Enumerate
1970s - the arcade - games are played in coin-operated arcades (full service)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
1980s, 1990s - the consoles - games are sold

\begin_inset Quotes eld

rented
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 through portals where additional features, levels, resources and modes
 may be accessed or purchased
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
EA provides a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

portal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or software distribution service called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Origin
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 where games may be bought, but much of

End user ecosystem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After a game is released, it is the responsibility of an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

operations
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 team to run customer services.
 The main purpose is to maintain customer satisfaction with what is termed
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

an active eco-system
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The operations team runs a specific portal for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Battlefield
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 users where additional levels or features might be accessed, a forum community
 for interaction between users.
 Activities such as competitions are hosted, top-scores are presented on
 leaderboards, and so on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As is customary with commercial online portals, activities of the users
 are monitored with analytics to learn about user trends, and to make direct
 suggestions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Co-creation?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While end users are able to host servers of their own, one might expect
 that end users also would be able to create content such as custom levels
 and artwork for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Battlefield
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which would then be distributable through DICE channels, but this is not
 so.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

, McKinsey&Company What Matters, February 26, 2009

\end_inset

, there should be an opportunity for DICE to further increase the engagement
 and commitment of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Battlefield
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 users by allowing them to contribute artwork and levels through a form
 of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is in fact possible in other EA titles such as

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Transparency
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The details of the creative design of games are largely treated as secrets
 before the release.
 While there are merits with this approach; such as anticipation, alure
 and sense of reward; there is a possibility that a deeper commitment and
 engagement might be achieved by opening the creative process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Growth
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The trend is heading for online distribution of games like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Battlefield
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but currenly, the large data size makes online distribution (downloading)
 unwieldy for many consumers as reliable high speed downloads are still
 uncommon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, there are several added benefits with the digital distribution
 model:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Payment details are negotiated in advance, making in-game purchases of value-add
 features (for example levels, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lives
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

weapons
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and so on) seamless.
 Mobile games (for example 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Candy Crush
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) provide good examples for this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Ability for community operators at DICE to make offers, award prices, and
 so on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The game studio Blizzard Entertainment has achieved legendary success with
 its franchise 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

World of Warcraft
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 using this model for distribution and revenue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While some of these goals are not currently practical for DICE, consideration
 should be made for aligning of tools and processes with these models.
\end_layout

Risks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the trend progresses towards 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

game as a service
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, we may be warned by the backlashes against overzealous copyright protection
 in earlier EA games, where the principal criticism from consumers was unfair

 transition towards

\begin_layout Section*
Technical (
\begin_inset Quotes erd

studio
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) customers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The source of some information here is based on an informal interview with
 an engineer at DICE, and represents an approximate instantaneous view of
 the operations.
 Procedures are continually updated, as decided by the nearest technical
 manager in the hierarchy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several teams at DICE serving technical users within EA.
 Several processes are in place for directing the communications between
 teams roughly following the model;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
requests for features at studios are escalated to product managers, project
 leaders (or equivalent titles)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
one person on the technical team at DICE is assigned as representative for
 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

studio customer
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and has regular communication with product managers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
EA executives may decide priority of requests, based on importance of the
 customer's product (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

FIFA
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 has top priority, because of volume of sales and revenue) though this need
 not always be explicit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Customer studios pay lump-sum for use of DICE tools, i.e.
 not royalty based
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The technical teams make regular releases of their tools, but development
 releases (which are previews, with less thorough testing) are available
 to studio customers on a self-serve basis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Studio customers may also make direct contributions to DICE tools, as such
 this is an example of co-creation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Professional services
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Employees from any EA studio may make visits to other EA studios for various
 reasons:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If external studio requests assistance with technology.
 In this case the receiving studio pays for developer time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Exchange
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 of employees can be arrange between studios.
 These are motivated with training, teaching and learning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\shape italic
(Travel and exchange are limited in budget)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Certain employees of the technical teams function as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

commandos
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and act as ready-to-go support for external studios.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Criticisms, factors of success
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this short survey of EA DICE internal service structure, we have found
 few to points to criticise.
 The structures seem few, sparsely documented, of an ad-hoc nature, and
 are reported to work well.
 The main challenges are reported to be communication of ideas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is unlikely the technical success is owed to meticulous design of procedures
 and structures.
 We look for factors of success elsewhere.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of note: there is no internal 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 within EA:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The studios design according to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

what feels right
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
and implement while using services from the technical teams on a self-serve
 basis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Technical teams serve the demand from studios without any notion of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

selling
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We make the observation that internal selling between teams/divisions would
 not serve the end product or end customer, only divisional results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To serve end customer; demand must flow from the outermost interpretation
 of customer demand - which is the game designer.
 Resources are assigned to the studio based on market success its products.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Incentive to perform seems to be based on meritocracy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Employee engagement and trust
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recruitment to leading roles are done through internal applications.
 Many influencial roles are filled by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

veterans
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with deep knowledge and experience.
 Because DICE is a young company with remarkable success and growth, the
 working environment is exceptional with respect to mix of experienced veterans
 and hopeful new recruits.
 One observation may be gleaned from reports of employees:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Competent, yet prestigeless environment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of note: there seems to be a strong incentive to produce excellent work,
 without 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

direct explicit incentives
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\shape italic
(there are stock-options-programs, but they are not directly correlated
 with individual effort.)
\shape default
 Rising the meritocracy seems to be incentive enough.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Conclusions: leadership
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
DICE provides an example of how effectively internal services can work,
 but provides little guidance on how to emulate it in terms of structures,
 procedures, and operations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The key factors at play are likely to be leadership, which merits further
 study.
